# Bad Bank Project

This is an academic project building a mocked bank interface. This project was built using React, Express, Node, and MongoDB Atlas.

## How to Run

This application runs in the web browser. Please do not use any of your real username or password credentials as this is not a fully secured application and is meant for demonstration purposes only.

## Current Features

<li>Deposit Page - Allows user to add to balance</li>
<li>Withdrawal Page - Allows user to subtract from balance</li>
<li>Balance Page - Shows user balance</li>
<li>Login Page - Allows user to authenticate and see stored values for account balance</li>
<li>Create Account Page - Creates a new user account entry and pushes information to database for storage</li>
<li>All Data Page - Shows all user data (email, name, balance)</li>
<li>Transfer Funds Page - Allows user to transfer money to another user of this bank by e-mail address and updates both users' balances</li>
<li>Delete Account Page - Allows user to delete their account and all data associated with account.</li>
<li>Logout Page - Logs current user out of Bad Bank application</li>
<li>Authentication allows users to see their specific information</li>
<li>User balance information is updated in database with each account transaction</li>
<li>Demo account allows for user to demo all functionality except delete account (since we do not want the demo account to be deleted and thus invalidated)</li>
